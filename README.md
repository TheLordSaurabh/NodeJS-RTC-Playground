# RTC Playground with Node.js

## Practice Module for RTC Protocols Usage

This repository serves as a comprehensive practice module for exploring and implementing various Real-Time Communication (RTC) protocols. It provides hands-on examples and tutorials for utilizing WebRTC, WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE), and Polling techniques to build real-time web applications.

### Features

* **WebRTC**: Peer-to-peer video, audio, and data communication examples.
* **WebSockets**: Real-time bi-directional communication between client and server.
* **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Server-to-client event streaming for live updates.
* **Polling and Long Polling**: Techniques for simulating real-time updates with periodic data fetching.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheLordSaurabh/NodeJS-RTC-Playground.git
   cd NodeJS-RTC-Playground
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the examples**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Contributions
